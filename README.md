# Computer Science: Data Structures

In high-level languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, we don't have to think
about exactly where and how to allocate memory for storing things like arrays
and hashes, or what algorithms are used to traverse these data structures when
we need to find or change a value. These low-level concerns are usually not
relevant to modern web development, but knowing the basics is considered a
hallmark of a good programmer, and the concepts frequently come up in interview
questions.

Since Ruby and JavaScript are the two languages you know best right now, we will
be implementing some low-level data structures and algorithms in these
languages, even though normally there would be no practical reason to do this.
It's important to understand that we are re-inventing the wheel to an extreme
degree here.

## Lab: Implement a Linked List

Low-level arrays (as implemented in C or C++) are contiguous blocks of memory
made up of many "cells", each of which contains a value. The one-block-of-memory
approach makes accessing arbitrary values fast and easy, but it means that you
have to know in advance how many array elements you want. Expanding arrays is an
expensive operation that involves reserving a new block of memory and copying
all the existing elements into it.

To solve this problem, the **linked list** was created. Each "value" within a
linked list is actually an object that contains two things: the value itself,
and a reference to the "next" element in the list. Adding a new element is as
simple as reserving the memory space for that element, and pointing the "next"
reference of what was previously the last element to the new element.

Implement a `LinkedList` class in Ruby or JavaScript. **Do not implement the
list as an array or hash,** or any built-in data type. Your class should be
capable of the following:

-   Append a new value to the end of the list
-   Prepend a new value to the beginning of the list
-   Find whether a given value is in the list
-   Insert a new value after a given value in the list
-   Remove a given value from the list (warning: tricky!)
-   Find the length of the list
-   Implement `to_s` or `toString` to return all values in the list

You may want to create a secondary class to represent the list elements
themselves, since each consists of two pieces of data. However, make sure not to
expose these objects to the user of your linked list.

### Bonus Challenges

These can be attempted in any order; they are not dependent on each other.

-   If you implemented your linked list in JavaScript, implement it in Ruby, or
    vice-versa.
-   Create a method to iterate through each value in the list. In Ruby you'll
    need to accept a block and use `yield`; in JavaScript you'll need to accept
    a callback function like `forEach` does on arrays.
-   Create a method that reverses the list. It can either return a new reversed
    list and leave the existing one alone, or reverse the existing list
    in-place. Or try doing both!
-   Upgrade your linked list to a **doubly-linked list**. In this variant of the
    linked list, each element holds references to both the "next" element and
    the "previous" element. You may find that it's much easier to remove a
    specific value from this kind of list.
-   Done-to-death interview question: Suppose you have a linked list that has
    been "corrupted" such that the links form a loop: if you tried to iterate
    through it, you'd keep going forever. Devise an algorithm that, given the
    first element of a linked list, would detect whether the list contains a
    loop.

## Optional Lab: Implement a Stack and a Queue

Stacks and queues are basically variants of the linked list that are optimized
for certain operations. Usually all of these operations take O(1) time and
space.

The **stack** typically only supports two operations: *push*, which adds a new
element to the end of the list, and *pop*, which removes and returns the element
at the end of the list. There is no mechanism for getting the length or
accessing elements other than the last one. There is sometimes a *peek*
operation, which returns the element at the end of the list without removing it
(this doubles as a way to determine whether the stack is empty).

The **queue** likewise only supports two operations: *enqueue*, which adds a new
element to the beginning of the list, and *dequeue*, which removes and returns
the element at the end of the list. As with the stack, there is no mechanism for
getting the length or accessing elements other than the last one.

Implement a `Stack` and a `Queue` in Ruby or JavaScript. As before, do not use
any of the built-in data types. If you wrote a "linked list element" class for
the last exercise, you should be able to reuse it as-is.

Question: What kinds of algorithms or applications would be well-suited to
stacks or queues?

## Optional Lab: Implement a Binary Tree

Both arrays and linked lists suffer from poor lookup and insertion performance:
Finding a specific value, or inserting a new value at an arbitrary position,
require O(n) time. **Tree** data structures, of which the **binary tree** is
one, can improve the performance of these operations (at the expense of others).

Each "value" within a binary tree is actually an object that contains three
things: The value itself, and references to a "left" node and a "right" node.
The first value inserted into the tree becomes the "root" node. The second value
is inserted either to the "left" or the "right" of the root node, depending on
how its value compares to the root node's value. Subsequent values are likewise
inserted to the left or right of some existing node in the tree based on value
comparisons.

Note that this algorithm requires all values inserted into the tree to be
**unique** and **comparable**: for any given value, you should be able to say
for sure that it is either "less than" or "greater than" any other value. If you
have duplicate values, or your values are of different types (e.g. strings and
integers) or otherwise cannot be compared, they cannot be stored in a binary
tree.

Implement a `BinaryTree` class in Ruby or JavaScript. As before, do not use any
of the built-in data types. Your class should be capable of the following:

-   Add a new value to the tree
-   Find whether a given value is in the tree
-   Remove a given value from the tree (warning: tricky!)
-   Implement `to_s` or `toString` to return all values in the tree

### Bonus Challenges

These can be attempted in any order; they are not dependent on each other.

-   Create a method to iterate through each value in the tree. In Ruby you'll
    need to accept a block and use `yield`; in JavaScript you'll need to accept
    a callback function like `forEach` does on arrays.
-   Upgrade your binary tree to a **hash tree**: instead of storing only a value
    for each node, store a *key* as well. Perform insertions and deletions based
    on the key, and add a method to retrieve the value associated with a key.
    (This might remind you of the built-in `Hash` class in Ruby. This is how
    some other languages implement hashes, but Ruby does it using a non-tree
    data structure called a **hash table**.)
-   Note that if the values inserted into the tree go in one "direction" much
    more frequently than another (e.g. they all go to the "left"), the tree can
    become "unbalanced". A completely unbalanced tree performs no better than a
    linked list. In this case we want to "rebalance" the tree, that is,
    rearrange its nodes to minimize the number of connections needed to access
    any given node. How might we do this?
